        <P><mark>Karnataka</mark> land is lying on Deccan plateau with Western Ghats connected to Arabian Sea. Mangalore port harbour lies in Karnataka. 
            Many igneous rock formations and hilly areas are the remarkable topography of the 
            land. Rivers-Krishna, Cauvery, Thunga Bhadra, Nethravathi and Hemavathy are sources 
            of Agricultural cultivation. Moderate and less monsoon rains are the only hopes for 
            agricultural cultivation. Natural vegetation and forests are found only in Ghats and river 
            bed regions, based on the even surfaces of land and availability of water. Food crops -
            Rice, Ragi, Maize, Jowar and millets and other commercial crops like coffee, Areca, 
            chillies, Coconut, tobacco and vegetables are grown. Except deficit of natural rains and 
            water resources, the land is fertile for agricultural cultivation. Annually some parts of 
            the state come under drought</P>

                   <b><dd>History</dd></b> 
                    <dt>Karnataka's pre-history goes back to a paleolithic hand-axe culture evidenced by discoveries of, among other things, hand axes and cleavers in the region.
                        Evidence of neolithic and megalithic cultures have also been found in the state. Gold discovered in Harappa was found to be imported from mines in Karnataka,
                         prompting scholars to hypothesise about contacts between ancient Karnataka and the Indus Valley civilisation
                       Prior to the third century BCE, most of Karnataka formed part of the Nanda Empire before coming under the Mauryan empire of Emperor Ashoka.
                        Four centuries of Satavahana rule followed, allowing them to control large areas of Karnataka. The decline of Satavahana power led to the rise of the earliest native kingdoms,
                         the Kadambas and the Western Gangas, marking the region's emergence as an independent political entity. The Kadamba Dynasty, founded by Mayurasharma, had its capital at Banavasi;
                         the Western Ganga Dynasty was formed with Talakad as its capital.</dt>

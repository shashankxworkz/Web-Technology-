        <h1>HARE KRISHNA</h1>
        <hr>
    

        <b> <i>Krishna</i></b>
        
        <P><mark>Krishna</mark> (/ˈkrɪʃnə/ Sanskrit: कृष्ण, IAST: Kṛṣṇa [ˈkr̩ʂɳɐ]) is a major deity in Hinduism. He is worshipped as the eighth avatar of Vishnu and also as the Supreme God in his own right.
             He is the god of protection, compassion, tenderness, and love  and is widely revered among Hindu divinities. Krishna's birthday is celebrated every year by Hindus on Krishna Janmashtami according to the lunisolar Hindu calendar
            which falls in late August or early September of the Gregorian calendar.
            The anecdotes and narratives of Krishna's life are generally titled as Krishna Līlā. He is a central figure in the <strong> Mahabharata</strong>,
             the Bhagavata Purana, the Brahma Vaivarta Purana, and the Bhagavad Gita, and is mentioned in many Hindu philosophical, theological, 
             and mythological texts.[19] They portray him in various perspectives: as a god-child, a prankster, a model lover, a divine hero, and the universal supreme being.
              His iconography reflects these legends and shows him in different stages of his life, such as an infant eating butter, a young boy playing a flute, 
              a young boy with Radha or surrounded by female devotees, or a friendly charioteer giving counsel to Arjuna.</P>

            <b><i>Radha Krishna</i></b>

            <p>In Krishnaism, Krishna is referred to as Svayam Bhagavan  and Radha is illustrated as the primeval potency of the three main potencies of God,
                 Hladini (immense spiritual bliss), Sandhini (eternality), and Samvit (existential consciousness), of which Radha is an embodiment of the feeling
                  of love towards Krishna (Hladini).
                With <mark>Krishna, Radha </mark>is acknowledged as the Supreme Goddess. Krishna is said to be satiated only by devotional service in loving servitude,
                 personified by Radha. Various devotees worship her to attain Krishna via her. Radha is also depicted to be Krishna himself, split into two for the purpose of his enjoyment.
                  As per scriptures, Radha is considered as the complete incarnation of Mahalakshmi.</p>
